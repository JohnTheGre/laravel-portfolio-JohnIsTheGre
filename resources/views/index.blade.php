        <section>
            <p class="p0">I am interested in the ICT field due to my interest in video game development and programming.
                Though I may not have had any programming skills yet, I am intrigued by the process of writing codes and
                watching its result come to fruition.
                My passion for gaming and the desire to create my very own games drives me towards this path. While I
                may not have had any education in programming,
                my goals include: </p>
            <ul class="p0">
                <li>creating a programming language that even a child could understand and one that is accessible to
                    all,
                </li>
                <li>designing non-lethal alternatives to guns/explosives, and creating one of the most remarkable games
                    ever.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p0">These aspirations fuel my desire to build my own successful company.</p>
